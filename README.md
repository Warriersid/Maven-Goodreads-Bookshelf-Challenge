# Maven-Goodreads-Bookshelf-Challenge

Navigating millions of book options can be daunting for readers seeking the perfect summer read. This project tackles that challenge by transforming 1 million+ Goodreads reviews and book metadata into visually intuitive insights and actionable recommendations.

By leveraging Power BI’s interactive dashboards and custom DAX measures, I developed a dynamic analytics solution that lets users explore trends across 14,000 books and thousands of authors. The dashboard enables:

Identification of top-rated and most-reviewed titles.

Exploration by author, genre, or individual book.

Analysis of average rating, reading time, review count, and user engagement at both summary and book-drilldown levels.

Key insights surfaced include:

Consistently high-performing books and authors by weighted reader ratings and engagement metrics.

Genre and author trends that drive user interest and positive reviews.

Patterns in reading completion time, helping readers pick titles to match their summer pace.

Impact:
This project improves decision-making for casual readers and book professionals alike. Readers receive tailored, data-driven recommendations to maximize their enjoyment and time, while publishers and marketers can spot hidden gems and audience preferences. The result is a scalable and interactive framework—powered by Power BI and DAX—that brings clarity and personalization to the summer reading experience.
